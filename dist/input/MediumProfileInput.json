    "summary": "In 2012 I started a company called The Lacrosse Network - my goal was to build a digital home for the sport I grew up playing. I saw an opportunity to connect the global community and create a platform to tell stories about the sport. \n\nAfter 2 years of building the network, we were acquired by Whistle Sports. At Whistle, I continued to build The Lacrosse Network while serving as the Director of Partnerships and Programming strategy - working with online creators of all sizes and developing strategies to build audiences and integrate brand partners. \n\nFrom there, I become an independent producer, creating content of my own with my partner Colin - as well as consulting with creators and brands to build engaged audiences. \n\nToday I host a show about the creator economy on YouTube and i'm building new projects that focus on helping creators scale their businesses. \n\nShow: http://YouTube.com/Colinandsamir \n\nNewsletter: http://thepublishpress.com",
